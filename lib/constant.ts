        description: "With its black dial, the Reverso Tribute Duoface Small Seconds watch revives the coloured dials created by the Maison in 1931, which epitomised a bold aesthetic choice. On this steel version, this comeback is the sign of an assertive modernity. On the front, the emblematic elements of the Reverso – gadroons, applied hour-markers, Dauphine hands, small seconds – in silver stand out against the black sunray-brushed dial. On the reverse, the second time zone is set using a small secret trigger on the side of the case when turned upside down. The watch is featured with two bracelets designed by Casa Fagliano: the first in black leather, the second in the same colour, leather and canvas.",
