    details: "Featuring the Duoface complication, the Reverso Tribute Duoface Small Seconds watch is inspired by the Art Deco codes of the very first models from 1931. On the front, the sunray-lacquered blue dial clearly displays its attributes and functions: railroad minute track, trapezoidal applied indexes, Dauphine hands and small seconds at 6 o’clock. On the reverse, the sunrayed silver dial gives way to a Night & Day indicator centred at 6 o’clock. The second time zone is easily set by means of a trigger on the side of the steel case. The watch is equipped with two bracelets designed by Casa Fagliano: the first in blue leather, the second in the same colour, leather and canvas.",
